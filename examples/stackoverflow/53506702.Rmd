It looks like you are viewing the table in RStuido via double clicking on the
`table1` in the "Environment" tab. The display is as expected. The structure of
the `qwraps2_summary_table` object is a character matrix. In or outside of RStudio
you can get the same result shown in the question post via `View(table1)`.

To see the well rendered html you'll need to knit a .Rmd to html. Or, in RStuido
you can upon a "R Notebook." A screen capture of of a simple example from an R
Notebook follows:

```{r, results = "asis"}
library(qwraps2)
options(qwraps2_markup = "markdown")
summary_table(mtcars)
```
