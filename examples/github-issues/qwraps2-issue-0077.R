#' Simple answers to both questions, yes, and yes.
#'
#' Some examples.  First we set up a simple summary table
#'
library(qwraps2)
library(dplyr)
options(qwraps2_markup = "markdown")

my_mtcars <- dplyr::select(mtcars, mpg, cyl, hp)
stats_summary <- list("MPG" =
                      list("min" = ~ qwraps2::frmt(min(.data[["mpg"]])),
                           "max" = ~ qwraps2::frmt(max(.data[["mpg"]]))))

st <- summary_table(dplyr::group_by(my_mtcars, cyl), stats_summary)

#'
#' The default table is
#'
st

#'
#' First question, is it possible to rename the columns, yes.  One way is to
#' define the column names via the `cname` argument of the print method for
#' the summary table.
#'
print(st, cname = c("Four Cylinders", "Six", "Eight"))

#'
#' Another way to rename the columns, and one that might be safer in a dynamic
#' program is to change the column names of the object.
#' Look at the structure of the `st` object.  It is a character matrix and the
#' column names used by the print method when the cname argument is not
#' provided.
str(st)
colnames(st)
colnames(st) <- gsub("cyl", "Cylinders", colnames(st))
colnames(st) <- gsub("\\(.*\\)", "", colnames(st))
st

#'
#' Reordering the columns is a little less intuitive right now.  Perhaps I
#' should extend the package features.  For now, I would suggest building an
#' factor in your data frame with the levels set in the order you want the
#' columns to appear in.
#'
my_mtcars$my_cyl <- factor(my_mtcars$cyl, levels = c(6, 4, 8), labels = c("Six", "Four", "Eight"))
summary_table(dplyr::group_by(my_mtcars, my_cyl), stats_summary)
